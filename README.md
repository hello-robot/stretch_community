# Overview

This README provides links to third-party repositories with code for the [Stretch mobile manipulator](https://hello-robot.com/product) from [Hello Robot](https://hello-robot.com). Hello Robot maintains this page, but typically does not test the code. These links are intended to help members of the Stretch community connect with one another and build on one another's work. 

If you would like us to add, remove, or edit a link to your repository, please email us at <support@hello-robot.com>.

| [Human-Centered Robotics Lab @ University of Washington](https://hcrlab.cs.washington.edu/) | We recommend this web interface for Stretch. [Prof. Maya Cakmak](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mcakmak/) has led its development. Her team has made major improvements to [Hello Robot's web interface](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_web_interface) and their code is under active development. Publication: [*"An Exploration of Accessible Remote Tele-operation for Assistive Mobile Manipulators in the Home"*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9515511)| [stretch-web-app](https://github.com/intuitivecomputing/stretch-web-app) |
| [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) | Meta AI is creating an ambitious new platform for robotics with leadership from [Soumith Chintala the creator of PyTorch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soumith) "Fairo is a unified robotics platform developed by researchers at Meta AI." [A blog post included a video with Stretch.](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/droidlet-a-one-stop-shop-for-modularly-building-intelligent-agents/) | [Fairo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairo) |
| [Emerging Tech @ Avanade](https://www.avanade.com/thinking/research-and-insights/trendlines/emerging-technologies) | Avanade has made their explorations available as open source, including work with [NextMind's brain computer interface](https://www.next-mind.com/technology/) via [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Microsoft Azure Internet of Things](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/iot/#overview), and [DroneDeploy Ground Robotics (formerly Rocos)](https://www.dronedeploy.com/product/ground-robotics/). [Fergus Kidd](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/fergus-kidd-1a222667) and [Chris Lloyd-Jones](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/chrislloydjones) have led this effort.| [emtech-stretch-labs](https://github.com/Avanade/emtech-stretch-labs)|
